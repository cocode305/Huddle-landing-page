## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS Utility Classes
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- I had to learn how to set up my own custom breakpoints, colors and font family.

- I also learnt to use @apply to create reusable classes to reduce filling my HTML with too much class utilities.

### Challenge 1
// Background Image File Path
- I encountered some challenges using bg-[url('')] to add a background image to the project, had to use Chatgpt to troubleshoot why it wasn't working. Turns out the file path wasn't correct and though gpt gave options to use a config file, I settled for using a custom class to define the background images instead.

#### How I solved it


### Challenge 2
- I couldn't get the order of the third card right. I wanted the image to come first on mobile screens then on wider screens, the text first.

#### How I solved it
- When I used the order utility class, I only added it to the image container, that didn't give me the result I wanted, so I tried adding the order class to the card content to and it worked fine.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
